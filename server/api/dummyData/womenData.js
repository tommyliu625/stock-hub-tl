The clouds on the rainbows are puffy, but they don't make the socks feel very different. For someone who likes a bit of stimming, these are fun to have on your feet. The different textures are nice to touch. The colors are bright, they're well-made, and for the price? A steal! AND you have fluffy rainbow clouds on your feet. There's nothing to complain about unless you don't like having fluffy rainbow clouds on your feet.",

      'Pair these petals with lingerie or clothing for extra coverage and a smooth look. For maximum comfort, make sure to keep the soft, padded center in place when applying. This item works best when applied to clean, dry skin that is free of deodorants, perfumes, lotions, or powders. These can be applied after the product is adhered to the skin.<br>Instructions For Removal: Use a small amount of baby oil and apply around the edges of the petals with a cloth. The baby oil should allow the medical grade adhesive to release from the skin before your Petals can be slowly removed.<br>We recommend that you perform a skin test 24 hours before extended use by wearing the Petals for up to four hours. If you experience any itching, irritation, burning or discomfort of any kind, remove the silicone immediately. Do not use on open cuts, skin disorders, rashes, sun damaged or sunburned skin, white patches or skin depigmentation problems. Even if you have had no previous reaction to this or other similar products, sensitivity may occur. Do not wear overnight, and we recommend that you do not wear it for more than 4-6 hours at a time. Women with a significant amount of melanin or family history of depigmentation may experience skin lightening from the silicone. Not recommended for women with sensitive skin.',

The ones I used last year went on easily without any air pockets. These updated ones leave 2-3 air pockets and take awhile to smooth out, if they do at all. You can see the air pockets through my shirt, which defeats the purpose. Tonight I removed one and it ripped part of my skin off and burned. Not sure why they changed them, but they shouldn’t have. Won’t be purchasing again.',

          'I am a medium in tops, size 6 in bottoms, 140lbs 5’3”. I got these in a medium and they fit true to size. They are not tight and slightly loose. The shorts are a good length, hit a few inches below the bottom of my bum. So, so soft, the softest pajamas ever. The fabric also keeps me cool.',

          "I love these socks! I typically buy ankle socks but these are great for wearing in boots or lounging around the house in. They are really soft and feel durable enough to last more than a few years without getting a hole in them. I like the fern print and I'm tempted to buy all of the other socks from this brand!",
