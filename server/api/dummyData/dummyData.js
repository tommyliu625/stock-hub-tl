      'The new AirPods deliver the wireless headphone experience, reimagined. Just pull them out of the charging case and they’re ready to use with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac. Powered by the all-new Apple H1 headphone chip, AirPods use optical sensors and motion accelerometers to detect when they’re in your ears. Whether you’re using both AirPods or just one, the H1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you’re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional speech-detecting accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out external noise and focus on the sound of your voice.',

          'I should have bought these AirPods a long time ago. Back then I would buy cheap knock off air phones but I finally caved in and bought air pods and they have changed my life. They are clear sound and a very good loud volume. They are perfect for calls. They charge very fast and they are very quick and easy to connect to your phone. If you are looking for wireless earbuds I recommend that you purchase these because they will revolutionize your daily life. Thank you so much.',

I don’t know what is that I’m doing but one always gives out on me. It’s starting to become annoying. I think I’m going to try to the AirPods Pro and see if that makes a difference.',

          "I'm hooked on this film now. It's so cheap with price matching, but even without price matching it's still not bad. This film has yet to fail me. The results are consistent and fun. For the adventurous ones, you can use this in a Polaroid 545 back with a custom film holder made of card stock or use it in a medium format camera and use an Instax camera to process the film with its rollers. (I recommend Instax Wide for the 4x5 cameras.) The high ISO doesn't mute the colors much and the size is actually perfect. Also, for those using Polaroid 300 cameras, the Polaroid branded film is just Fuji Instax mini film. You can use the Fuji Instax film instead and not have to pay the high price Polaroid ends up charging perhaps due to licensing costs. (If you check your Polaroid 300 film box, it will say made in Japan...really, it's made by Fuji but Polaroid pays to sell it under its name.) Fantastic film, great results every time. Addicting.",

Whether you’re using both AirPods or just one, the H1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you’re on a call or talking to Siri, an additional speech-detecting accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out external noise and focus on the sound of your voice.',

            'I should have bought these AirPods a long time ago. Back then I would buy cheap knock off air phones but I finally caved in and bought air pods and they have changed my life. They are clear sound and a very good loud volume. They are perfect for calls. They charge very fast and they are very quick and easy to connect to your phone. If you are looking for wireless earbuds I recommend that you purchase these because they will revolutionize your daily life. Thank you so much.',

            'These are my second time buying them, because overall they’re alright. However I keep experiencing the same issue, one earbud will give out or the sound quality weakens. I don’t know what is that I’m doing but one always gives out on me. It’s starting to become annoying. I think I’m going to try to the AirPods Pro and see if that makes a difference.',

Since you are able to see the battery life when put into the controllers, some of them started out at less than half life! I'm thinking maybe they were old. I should have thought to check the expiration dates. I won't be ordering batteries from Target again!",

Wore them on a 20 mile bike ride with no issues and usually I'm readjusting my earbuds every few minutes. Love the sound and the noise canceling is just enough to block out the background but still let me hear vehicles coming while riding.",

            'Sound is decent IF they actually stay in. They won’t stay in my ears regardless of size of ear piece. They don’t even stay in when sitting still talking on the phone. Every single person I’ve talked to has the same issue. Basic earbuds always fell out but these overpriced higher end model do not. Can’t run or workout in them unless I hold them in. So disappointed. Can’t believe I spent so much on them. They look great, have great features but sound and fit is sorely lacking. Going back to my Beats which is a superior product and you get more for your money! Hopefully I can sell these.',

            "I'm hooked on this film now. It's so cheap with price matching, but even without price matching it's still not bad. This film has yet to fail me. The results are consistent and fun. For the adventurous ones, you can use this in a Polaroid 545 back with a custom film holder made of card stock or use it in a medium format camera and use an Instax camera to process the film with its rollers. (I recommend Instax Wide for the 4x5 cameras.) The high ISO doesn't mute the colors much and the size is actually perfect. Also, for those using Polaroid 300 cameras, the Polaroid branded film is just Fuji Instax mini film. You can use the Fuji Instax film instead and not have to pay the high price Polaroid ends up charging perhaps due to licensing costs. (If you check your Polaroid 300 film box, it will say made in Japan...really, it's made by Fuji but Polaroid pays to sell it under its name.) Fantastic film, great results every time. Addicting.",

            "I've had several AAA batteries leak without even being used. The latest battery to fail has a date of Dec 2025. I used to think that the Duracell brand was the best on the market but not anymore. The next time I buy batteries I'm switching to Eveready for a test. Unfortunately Eveready batteries are made in China and possibly Duracell are also.",
