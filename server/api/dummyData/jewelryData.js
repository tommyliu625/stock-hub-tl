One of the metal loops on the clasp broke off, so it wasn’t even wearable. The necklace with the star charms is supposed to have 3 stars, and mine only has 2. Also, one of the necklaces with a single small gem has something really weird going on with the chain... it’s like there are extra, unnecessary loops in the chain and a random metal piece in there. I’ll attach a picture so you can see what I mean. Lastly, some of the clasps were stuck shut and I thought I was going to break the necklace trying to get it open. I’m really disappointed because they all are so cute but I will definitely be returning them soon... too many issues.',

          'This jewelry cleaner works much better than I anticipated. It is single use. All you have to do is fill the container with water followed by the addition of ten drops of solution, which come in a separate bottle, then shake it up a bit. What I like the most is that the solution is fresh every time so I am not re-dipping in dirty cleaner. Jewelry comes out dazzling! There is a brush supplied for those items that need a little extra cleaning or hard to reach areas. The solution bottle is a nice size so it can be used many times.',
